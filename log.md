# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Got back into the mindframe of learning to code, Setup my plan as I am going to work on Learning to Code with Fantasy Football but publish my code on github to track progress and stay on track this time.  Refreshed the previous work to get ready for my 100 days of coding. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with consistency and motivation so I am hoping by keeping myself more accountable with this challenge I will stay consistent and follow through with becoming a compentent programmer
